## 🧠 Deep Learning Projects - By Ibrahim Bagwan

As an AI/ML enthusiast, I've compiled these deep learning projects to showcase practical applications of neural networks in **computer vision**, **natural language processing**, and **time series forecasting**.

Each project provides complete code, training scripts, and Jupyter notebooks, primarily built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **PyTorch**.

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- Image classification using **CNNs** and **Transfer Learning**
- Sentiment analysis with **RNNs / LSTMs**
- Object detection using **YOLO / SSD**
- Time series prediction using **LSTM / GRU**
- Experiment tracking and visualization with **TensorBoard / Matplotlib**

## ⚙️ Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IbrahimBagwan1/deep-learning-projects.git
cd deep-learning-projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## ▶️ Example Usage
Train a CNN model:

```bash
python image_classification/train.py --epochs 30 --batch-size 64
```

View model performance:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/
```

## 🧾 Data
All datasets are publicly available (e.g., CIFAR-10, IMDB, COCO).
Each project folder includes instructions for downloading and preparing the dataset.
