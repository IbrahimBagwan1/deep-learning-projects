## 🧠 Deep Learning Projects

As an AI/ML enthusiast, I've compiled these deep learning projects to showcase practical applications of neural networks in **computer vision**, **natural language processing**, and **time series forecasting**.

Each project provides complete code, training scripts, and Jupyter notebooks, primarily built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **PyTorch**.

## 🧾 Data
All datasets are publicly available (e.g., CIFAR-10, IMDB, COCO).
Each project folder includes instructions for downloading and preparing the dataset.
